Font rendering in Firefox was quite poor in the Fedora KDE Plasma spin.

Digging around found a lot of font issues in many distros besides Ubuntu. Seems Ubuntu has it all figured out.

The fix was to create a .fonts.conf file in ~ and copy a bit of xml to it. The file is in this repository. Download it, and put it in your home folder.
